### Example

A simple example that interaction between two servers, as well as Disco REPL feature.

Start servers in two terminal windows:

```javascript
$ DEBUG=disco node server1
$ DEBUG=disco node server2
```

We set `DEBUG` environment variable to enable debug information in the console.

You should see servers print messages into console.
